今天读吴军的硅谷来信，《斯卡保罗集市》

《硅谷来信》是一扇窗户，我身处自己那黑漆漆的屋子里，踮着脚尖，透过窗户，看到：澳大利亚、看到了北极光、看到斯卡保罗集市，看到了硅谷，看到了美国的大学，看到了那闪着光芒的智者的思想，看到了奢侈品的诞生、落寞，看到了红酒的产生、如何品红酒，看到了投资的智慧......

说回今天的斯卡保罗集市：

Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
Remember me to one who lives there,
For once she was a true love of mine.
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
Without any seam or needlework,
Then she shall be a true lover of mine.
Tell her to wash it in yonder well,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
Where never spring water or rain ever fell,
And she shall be a true lover of mine.
Tell her to dry it on yonder thorn,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
Which never bore blossom since Adam was born,
Then she shall be a true lover of mine.
Now he has asked me questions three,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
I hope he'll answer as many for me,
Before he shall be a true lover of mine.
Tell him to buy me an acre of land,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
Betwixt the salt water and the sea sand,
Then he shall be a true lover of mine.
Tell him to plough it with a ram's horn,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
And sow it all over with one pepper corn,
And he shall be a true lover of mine.
Tell him to shear it with a sickle of leather,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
And bind it up with a peacock feather,
And he shall be a true lover of mine.
Tell him to thrash it on yonder wall,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
And never let one corn of it fall,
Then he shall be a true lover of mine.
When he has done and finished his work,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
Oh, tell him to come and he'll have his shirt,
And he shall be a true lover of mine.


触动了我的心灵，有了那么一丝丝的感动，有如此美好的音乐，更多的来自于这首音乐描述的感情。

今天还听了吴军老师关于，命运的最后一部分：比贫穷更可怕的是什么？

比贫穷更可怕的是：没有智慧，认知无法得到提升，没有规矩；

我们的命运由什么决定？
* 我们的出身
* 我们身处的环境
* 父母的学识
* 自己的努力
* 所身处的大时代

这这些错综复杂的外界环境中，影响都是有的，但都不是绝对因素。自己是否努力，这是决定自己命运的决定因素。

认知水平，观念，对待事物的看法，几乎决定了我们的一生，决定了我们的命运。

我在想一个问题，为什么我听老师讲的时候，就感觉老师讲的很好，而且我也很同意。为什么，我自己描述的时候，却无论如何也组织不出语言来？

这是为什么呢？
